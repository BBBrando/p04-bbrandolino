####User Input and Output
#####[car.cpp lines 9-11](/car.cpp#L10)  I used input and output to use user data to build the specifications for a car.
####Control Flow
#####[car.cpp lines 12-14](/car.cpp#L14) [car.cpp lines 30-32](/car.cpp#L32)  I used if statements to validate the entered information and ask for reentry if needed.
#####[car.cpp lines 155-160](/car.cpp#L160)   I used ifelse and else statements to validate calculated information to make sure that the lesser number is used.
####Iteration
#####[main.cpp lines 16-35](/main.cpp#L35)  I used a while loop to allow the program to make multiple output files
#####[car.cpp lines 78-81](/car.cpp#L81)  I used a for loop to populate a vector of doubles.
####Data Structures
#####[car.cpp lines 77-81](/car.cpp#L81)  I created a vector to hold gear values for the program.
#####[car.cpp lines 141-146](/car.cpp#L146)  I used one vector to calculate values to place into another vector.
####Functions
#####[car.h lines 41-49](/car.h#L49)  I created void functions to fill in variables for the car
#####[car.cpp lines 141-147](/car.cpp#L146)  I used pass by reference to give the function the values of a vector so i did not make a new copy of the original vector.
#####[main.cpp lines 22](/main.cpp#L22)  I used pass by value to give the file output a name.
####Output
#####[main.cpp lines 22-34](/main.cpp#L34)  I used file output to make a spec sheet for each created car.
####Class
#####[car.h lines 1-77](/car.h#L77) [car.cpp lines 1-174](/car.cpp#L174)  I made a class to create a car object.
